# Set temperature -- a parameter in the OpenAI API that controls the randomness of the generated text. It is a floating-point value that ranges from 0 to 1. A higher value (e.g., 0.8) will result in more random and creative outputs, while a lower value (e.g., 0.2) will produce more focused and deterministic outputs. In this case, the temperature is set to 0.5, which provides a balance between creativity and determinism in the generated text.

By specifying the path to the virtual environment, the project can reference and activate the environment when needed, ensuring that the correct dependencies are used during execution.
